# GraphMiningResources
### Yajun Huang, 黄亚军

I create this repository for collecting study resources and wirting notes about graph mining.

### Note: The Mian Guilt-by-Association Approaches: 
- Random Walk with Restarts
- Semi-Supervised Learning
- Belief Propagation.

### Random Walk with Restarts, PageRank
